# 🖥️ Computer Architecture – UBB

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the **Computer Architecture** course at **Babeș-Bolyai University (UBB)**.  
All assignments are implemented in **Assembly**, using **OllyDbg** for debugging and analysis.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized using the following folder convention:

Each folder represents a homework or assignment, where `XX` is the assignment number.  
For example:

hw1/ ->Homework1 for Laboratory1


Inside each folder, you’ll typically find:
- `.asm` source files — the main assembly solutions
- `.exe`  — compiled binaries (if applicable)
